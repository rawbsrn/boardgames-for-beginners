# **Project Proposal Template**

## Name of Student

Robert Sameh

## Name of Project

Board Games for Beginners

## Project's Purpose or Goal: _(What will it do for users?)_

Help people find new board games to play based on their mechanical likes, genre tastes, player count, and other factors. Once a game has been suggested, if they like the suggestion it will query another site to find similar games to recommend.

## List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal

- Give users a quiz to determine what game to recommend
- Recommend games from a specified list based on certain factors

## What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific

- Javascript
- Angular
- Bootstrap
- Node.js

## If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific

1. Send user to a website that's been pre filled out with their info from the quiz if the user wants to search for more games
2. Work on rewriting the recommendation part of the UI in React
3. Hosting in Google Cloud / another provider

## What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

- Python
- Docker
- Turicreate
- React
- Google Cloud

## Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?

I will be heavily incorporating someone else's code from [here](https://gitlab.com/recommend.games) in order to do the further recommendations part of the project. It's a purpose built tool that does exactly what I need it to, and unfortunately the maintainer is taking his example website (but not his repo) offline this month. It was fortuitous that I found it when I did. I've gotten the web scraper working on my own, and I am confident that I can get the rest of his code working readily in the course of working through this project
