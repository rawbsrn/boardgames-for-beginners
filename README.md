## Description

There are no good resources that exist for people that are getting into boardgames as a hobby that want to get beyond staples such as Monopoly (which is a bad game) or Settlers of Catan. Resources exist for enfranchised gamers, such as  [BoardGameGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com/), or how to play guides on popular games on YouTube, which all can be helpful ways to learn about new games but can be difficult to navigate unless you know what you are looking for already. Top 10 lists from the New York Times are often targeted at people that are shopping for gamers but themselves may not have an interest in playing.

This website aims to fill the gap between all of these existing resources helping new board gamers find exemplary, easy to pick up and play games that can expose them to new mechanics and themes that they will continue to enjoy replaying within their gaming group. By having a curated list to reccomend from, we can help them have a better experience than if they picked something up off the shelf at their local gaming store or off of Board Game Geek's THE HOTNESS list.

The website asks simple identifying questions based on your past gaming experiences and other factors, such as number of players in your group, to guide you to which games will fit your gaming groups needs the best.

## Methodology for selecting recommended games

- Selected games based on multiple factors:
- complexity / amount of mechanics per game
- good examples of the mechanics featured in each games
- playtime of games
- "easy to learn" + high replayability
- price point / ease of purchasing access of each game (nothing is out of print/etc.)

## Setup/Installation Requirements

### Getting Started with Create React App and Redux

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

#### Available Scripts

In the project directory , you can run:

##### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

###### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

###### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

###### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

#### Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
